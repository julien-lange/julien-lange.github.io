Hello!

Research interests
======

My research interests are centred on developing mathematically
rigorous theories and tools to support software practitioners in
specifying, designing, maintaining and implementing concurrent and
distributed programs.


Background
======
Before joining the Department of Computer Science at Royal Holloway, I
was a lecturer at The University of Kent. Before that I was a Research
Associate at Imperial College London, in Nobuko Yoshida's group in the
project From Data Types to Session Types -- A Basis for Concurrency
and Distribution. I obtained my PhD from the University of Leicester
under the supervision of Emilio Tuosto, while working as a Graduate
Teaching Assistant. Before moving to Leicester, I worked for a year in
The Netherlands at the European Space Agency in the On-board Software
Systems section, as part of the YGT programme. I am originally from
Belgium, where I graduated (BSc and MSc) from the University of Namur
-- Maitrise en Science Informatique, avec Grande Distinction.
